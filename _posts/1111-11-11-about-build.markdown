This site has gone through dozens of iterations in the 15+ years that I've owned this domain. At first it was the home of a musical project I worked on as a teenager, but as priorities shifted it became my professional home base. Each time I introduce a new version of this site I hope to leverage new practices and technologies to ensure a modern experience across all devices.

Right now, this static single-page site was generated using GitHub's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) tool. Styles were written following the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) methodology and processed using the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor. This site's code is housed in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/gvorbeck/iamgarrett-static).
