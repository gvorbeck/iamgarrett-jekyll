        <p>I was a client-facing consultant for installing and strategic analysis of GPS tracking software. Before the days of smartphones, I helped set-up and create systems for clients to track workers as well as create a user-friendly dispatching procedure for specific tasks assigned to employees in the field. This included working with various individuals of management and their employees, both over the phone and on-site.</p>
